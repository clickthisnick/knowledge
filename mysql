Lock down a user to a certain ip address:

# See all the mysql users:
SELECT * FROM mysql.user;

# Create a new user that can login from anywhere:
CREATE USER 'lala'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'blahblah';

# Create a new user that can only login from a 10.xxx... ip:
CREATE USER 'lala'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'blahblah';

# Create a new user that can only login from localhost
CREATE USER 'lala'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'blahblah';
