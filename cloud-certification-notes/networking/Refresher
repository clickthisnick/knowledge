Networking exists to ensure machines can communicate

7-Layer OSI model was created to ensure machines with different specs/protocols can reliably communicate with each other

7 - Application 
6 - Presentation
5 - Session - Ongoing sessions, allows to connect to machines and keep it up. Ports. 
4 - Transport - TCP/UDP. TCP (3 way handshake retry/safe), UDP - Live streaming, no error handling/checking
3 - Network, Communicate via IP address. Protocols - IP, IPX, ICMP (ping) - This layer doesn't handle errors.
2 - Datalink - Communicate via frame. Source/Destination MAC Address. Handles errors or frame out of order
1 - Physical - Ethernet/Wifi/Bluetooth. This layer knows how to send data and how to receive data.

Each layer is self contained. Each layer has inputs and outputs.
